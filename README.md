# Examining-Dog-Bites-In-New-York

# Introduction

This project entails a study on the dog bite cases in New York. The data used for the study is retrieved from NYC Open Data (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-Dog-Bite-Data/rsgh-akpg) as an excel file. The raw data is first preprocessed using sql and exported into a different sheet of the excel file. Following that, the data is visualized with Tableau to obtain insights.

# Findings

Here is a summary of all the findings on Tableau:

 1. Most dogs involved in dog bite cases are not neutered
 2. Dog Bites in New York occur most in Queens and Brooklyn
 3. Pit bulls are the dominant culprit in dog bite cases
 4. Most dogs in dog bite cases are male (difficult to draw conclusion from this without knowing the gender disparity in dogs)
